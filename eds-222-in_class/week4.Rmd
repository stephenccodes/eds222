### Use palmer penguins to fit a model that has an interaction between a CONTINUOUS and CATEGORICAL variable

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
penguins1 <- penguins
```

```{r}
# body_mass = B0 + B1flipper + B2sex=male + B3flipperxsexmale
body_flipper_sex <- summary(lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + sex + flipper_length_mm : sex, penguins1))

ggplot(penguins1, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = -5443.9607, slope = 47.1527, color = "red") +
  geom_abline(intercept = -5443.9607, slope = 47.1527 + -0.2942 , color = "blue")

# relationship between the slopes is very similar, maybe this relationship doesn't tell us much
```


# Use palmer penguins to fit a model that has an interaction between two CONTINUOUS variables


```{r}
